##  Matrix algorithms and numerical methods

**Status**: *Ongoing*

*These are a bunch of python programs on matrix methods (Gaussian elimination and whatnot) and numerical methods (Runge-Kutta, etc.) that I have written, am writing now, or plan to write in the near future. I'm doing these for learning and to use it in small projects. This should be fun!*    
    
**Currently working on**: *Gaussian Elimination*

*What I've coded so far:*
