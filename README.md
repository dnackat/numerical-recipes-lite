##  Matrix algorithms and numerical methods

**Status**: *Ongoing*

*These are a bunch of python programs on matrix methods (Gaussian elimination and whatnot), numerical methods (Runge-Kutta, etc.), and some simple CFD codes that I have written, am writing now, or plan to write in the near future. I'm doing these for learning and to use it in small projects. This should be fun!*    
    
**Currently working on**: *Writing toy CFD codes as practice for the CFD using FVM course I'm currently doing*

*What I've coded so far:*    
    
### Matrix algorithms
M1. *Gaussian elimination*     
M2. *Pascal's triangle matrix*    
M3. *Permutation matrix for row and column exchanges*

### Numerical Methods    
N1. *Newton's method*    
N2. *Constrained optimization example using Lagrange Multiplier method*    
N3. *Best fit parabola for data using least-squares approximation* 

### Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
C1. *Solution to 1D diffusion equation using the Finite-Volume method (FVM)*
